# Design System Patterns

## When to Use This Skill
- Architecting a multi-brand theming system for a product suite.
- Implementing a comprehensive light/dark mode switch with persistent storage.
- Establishing a design-to-code workflow utilizing Figma tokens for component properties.
- Creating a hierarchical structure for design tokens, from primitive to component-specific values.

## Pro Tips
- Prioritize a clear token naming convention (e.g., `color-surface-primary`, `font-size-body-md`) to ensure maintainability and discoverability across large teams.
- When building theming, always consider accessibility from the outset, including high-contrast modes and reduced motion preferences, rather than as an afterthought.
- Integrate automation for token generation and component documentation. Tools like Style Dictionary or Storybook can drastically improve consistency and developer experience.
